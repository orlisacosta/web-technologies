	<p id = "website_g_1"> A website can be like a galaxy. Galaxies take a long time to be formed. But eventually all the elements come together. The stardust becomes small rocks which eventually become stars and planets. Some rocks only grow enough to become a comet, or a moon. All these celestial bodies are arranged with a very defined hierarchy. Moons will orbit planets, and then those planets will orbit stars. Then these solar systems gather together to form galaxies. These galaxies can even merge with other galaxies to form a completely new one. 
A website will work in the same way. It takes a long time to be made, but eventually smaller elements are grouped together to form different systems that behave differently but still work together to achieve the formation of a larger group.
